## general notes

* the API takes and returns XML as well as JSON â€“ the latter is more easily consumed by Javascript applications, while the former is easier to read and understand.
	* for this to work, set the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to `application/xml` or `application/json`, respectively.
* The complete match structure is [defined in a DTD](../../lib/match.dtd)
